# HITEC UNIVERSITY NETWORK
Whole network of hitec university is made on cisco packet tracer.This network design is cost effective.
## Link Aggregation
Link aggregation is between switches of different labs i.e., between switches of the CS department, electrical department, and Sir Syed department because it provides various benefits that contribute to improved performance, reliability, and efficiency.
## Vlans
Separate VLANs are made for each lab in departments.<br>VLANs isolate broadcast traffic within each lab, preventing unnecessary congestion on the overall network.<br>Different labs can have separate VLANs, ensuring the isolation of sensitive data and restricting unauthorized access.<br>
Each lab gets dedicated network resources, preventing one lab from impacting the performance of others.
## Access Points:
Access points on inside and outside departments for high speed and good performance in every area of the university so that each student can be facilitated.
## Router Configuration:
We have done router on a stick configuration so achieve inter vlan routing.<br>

In conclusion, the implementation of Cisco technologies, featuring link aggregation and VLANs, has significantly improved our university's network. This project successfully increased bandwidth, improved fault tolerance, and optimized resource allocation through link aggregation. The use of VLANs enhanced security, isolated broadcast domains, and provided flexibility for different labs.Access points are inserted within block and ouside the blocks to ensure no shadow area. The seamless integration of these technologies positions our network for scalability and adaptability, ensuring a reliable, secure, and high-performance infrastructure for the university community.
